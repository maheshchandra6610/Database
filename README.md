# Database
My first Database using PostgreSQL with JAVA

Used the pg4admin to manage the database.
Create a database first.
then copy the code and make sure it has no errors connecting the the PostgreSQL server.
Then, edit the SQL statement to make changes to the database.
Make sure to  change the details of the database in the code to make the connection successful.
